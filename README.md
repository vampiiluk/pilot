Pilot makes it simple to run Frappe on your own servers. Use the Admin UI to manage apps, sites, processes, backups, domains, and production setup, with a CLI for automation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **What's New in This Fork** — this is the **vampiiluk/pilot** fork of Frappe
> Pilot, synced with upstream `develop`. It ships everything upstream **plus**
> the site-recovery features below.
>
> - **Restore a backup into a new site:** any backup run can be restored as a
>   brand-new site — DB plus optional public/private files — straight from the
>   dashboard. Files already pruned by retention are re-fetched from offsite
>   storage first.
> - **Archived-sites management:** browse sites parked in the archive, move a
>   backup run back into a live site's backup folder, or delete a whole archived
>   site — all from the Sites page.
> - **Offsite backup quotas & Cloudflare R2:** S3 settings gain an endpoint and a
>   per-site size cap (in GB); R2 is a first-class provider and uploads stop with
>   a warning once a site's bucket usage would exceed the quota.
> - **Forced-download backup links:** presigned S3 URLs force an `attachment`
>   disposition so browsers download backups instead of rendering them.
> - **Cross-platform size reporting:** directory sizes use POSIX `du -sk` and DB
>   sizes use engine-specific queries (MariaDB/PostgreSQL) instead of fragile
>   schema-size guesses.
> - **Self-updates from this fork:** the release-checker tracks `vampiiluk/pilot`
>   releases, so the installer keeps your deployment on the fork.

## Key Features

- Bench and site lifecycle: create, update, rename, restore, back up, and drop
- Integrated marketplace to install apps on sites from Git repositories or the app registry
- Local development runner for Redis, web, workers, socket.io, and Admin UI
- Production setup for process managers, nginx, monitoring, domains, and TLS
- Devtools for investigation: SQL playground, database analyzer, binlog browser, logs, and task history

## Requirements

- Debian 12+, Ubuntu 22.04+, Fedora 40+, Arch Linux, or macOS with Homebrew for local development
- Python 3.11+

## Installation

Run the installer as your normal user:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frappe/pilot/develop/install.sh | bash
```

On a root-only VPS, run it as root; the installer creates a non-root bench user.

This installs the latest release (prebuilt admin UI, no build step). Contributors
who want a source checkout that compiles the admin UI locally can pass `--dev`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frappe/pilot/develop/install.sh | bash -s -- --dev
```

## Basic Usage

Create a bench and launch the setup wizard:

```bash
pilot new dev-bench
pilot -b dev-bench start
```

The first `start` will print the url to access the admin wizard. The wizard asks for the Admin password, database settings, and Frappe source settings, then initializes the bench with live task progress.

Common commands:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pilot new <name>` | Create a bench and `bench.toml` |
| `pilot ls` | List benches, status, production state, and Admin URL |
| `pilot -b <name> init` | Initialize a bench from `bench.toml` |
| `pilot -b <name> start` | Start development processes |
| `pilot -b <name> stop` | Stop development processes |
| `pilot -b <name> get-app <repo>` | Clone and install an app |
| `pilot -b <name> new-site <site>` | Create a site |
| `pilot -b <name> update` | Pull apps, install deps, build assets, and migrate sites |
| `pilot -b <name> setup production` | Configure process manager, nginx, Admin domain, and optional TLS |
| `pilot -b <name> restart` | Restart production processes |
| `pilot -b <name> remove production` | Remove production deployment files and services |

For the full command list, see [Commands](docs/commands.md).

## Configuration

Each bench has one `bench.toml`. It is the source of truth for apps, database, Redis, workers, production, nginx, gunicorn, Let's Encrypt, Admin, firewall, WAF, S3, and monitoring settings.

Minimal shape:

```toml
[bench]
name = "main"
python = "3.11"

[[apps]]
name = "frappe"
repo = "https://github.com/frappe/frappe"
branch = "version-16"

[mariadb]
host = "localhost"
port = 3306
root_password = "your-root-password"

[redis]
cache_port = 13000
queue_port = 11000

[[workers]]
queues = ["default", "short", "long"]
count = 1

[admin]
port = 8002
password = "your-admin-password"
domain = ""
tls = false
```

Apps and sites also exist on disk under the bench. See [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) for every config section.

## Production

Production setup writes process-manager config, nginx integration, Admin routing, monitoring config, and optional Let's Encrypt certificates.

```bash
pilot -b main setup production --admin-domain admin.example.com
pilot -b main setup production --admin-domain admin.example.com --tls --letsencrypt-email ops@example.com
```

The Admin domain is required in production. Set `admin.tls = false` when HTTPS terminates at an upstream proxy.

Supported process managers:

- `systemd`
- `supervisor`
- `none` for local development

See [Production](docs/production.md).

## Admin UI

The Admin UI runs on `[admin] port`, usually `8002`. It exposes bench status, apps, marketplace installs, sites, backups, domains, processes, logs, tasks, database tools, updates, and settings.

Long-running Admin operations return task IDs. Task progress, logs, callbacks, and final status are handled by `pilot.tasks`.

See [Admin UI](docs/admin-ui.md) and [Admin API](docs/admin-api.md).

## Development

<details>
<summary>Development setup and checks</summary>

Use a source checkout when working on Pilot:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frappe/pilot ~/pilot
cd ~/pilot
export PATH="$PWD/bin:$PATH"
```

Create a development bench:

```bash
pilot new dev
pilot -b dev start
```

Useful development toggles in `bench.toml`:

```toml
[bench]
watch_apps_js = true
reload_python = true
watch_admin_js = true
```

Run checks:

```bash
uv run ruff check admin pilot tests
uv run pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/integration
```

Integration tests under `tests/integration/` use real services and run the full bench lifecycle.

## Contributing

Keep CLI commands and Admin API routes thin. Put behavior on the closest core object: `Server`, `Bench`, `Site`, `App`, or a task.

Read [SPEC.md](SPEC.md), [Architecture](docs/architecture.md), and [Commands](docs/commands.md) before changing behavior.
