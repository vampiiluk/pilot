# Agent Guide

This repo is a Python CLI plus Flask Admin backend for managing Frappe benches. Prefer small, direct changes that keep the object model easy to use.

## Main Rules

- Put real behavior in `pilot.core`, managers, or tasks.
- Keep CLI commands and API routes thin.
- Use `Server`, `Bench`, `Site`, and `App` as the main entry points.
- Group related files in folders instead of adding many same-prefix modules.
- Avoid lazy re-exports in package `__init__.py` when autocomplete matters.
- Keep comments short. Remove comments that restate the code.
- Do not put comments at the top of a file. Use a short, terse class or method docstring instead.
- Do not create or commit plan/planning markdown files (e.g. `plan_*.md`); keep them out of git.

## Useful Entry Points

- `pilot/core/server/__init__.py`: host-level operations.
- `pilot/core/bench/__init__.py`: bench object and bench-level operations.
- `pilot/core/site/__init__.py`: site object and site-level operations.
- `pilot/core/app/__init__.py`: app object and repository operations.
- `pilot/tasks/__init__.py`: public task API and task exports.
- `pilot/internal/cli`: argparse and command dispatch internals.
- `admin/backend/api/v1`: Admin API route groups.

## Design Expectations

Use object-owned syntax when adding features:

```python
bench = Server().bench("main")
site = bench.site("site.local")
InstallAppTask.queue(bench, site="site.local", apps=["erpnext"])
```

Avoid new APIs that pass a bench and site into unrelated helper objects when the operation can live under `bench`, `site`, `app`, or `server`.

## Code Taste

These rules are mandatory for agents changing this repo:

- Choose clean code over clever code.
- Prefer explicit config over implicit behavior.
- Prefer object-oriented code where it maps to the domain.
- Keep functions small. Around 25 lines is a useful target, not a reason to split readable code blindly.
- Keep cyclomatic complexity <= 8
- Keep files between 100 and 500 lines when practical.
- Avoid crowded modules. If a folder grows too large, group related files into a subfolder instead of adding more same-prefix files.
- Avoid abbreviations.
- Use standard APIs and existing repo helpers before adding custom logic.
- Reuse existing patterns. Write as little new code as the change needs.
- Delete before adding when existing code can be simplified.
- For Admin UI, use Frappe UI and the Espresso design system by default.
- Always add or update tests for behavior changes, and make sure they pass.
- Build the minimum working change, then iterate.
- Keep comments and docstrings terse. Explain only what the code does not already make obvious.
- Put detailed change explanation in commit messages or docs, not inline comments.
- Keep one owner for state that can drift out of sync.
- Keep state scoped. Do not let temporary state leak across object or module boundaries.
- Fail loudly near the bug. Do not hide corrupt or partial state behind broad fallbacks.
- Retry only operations that are safe to repeat.
- For a no-argument method that computes and returns one noun-like value, use `@property`, such as `nginx_version`.
- For methods with arguments or multi-step work, prefer `get_<what_it_returns>()`, such as `get_commit_sha()`.
- Default to public methods. Use a leading underscore only for raw parsing, security-sensitive validation, OS plumbing, or genuinely internal details callers should not reach for.
- Do not make a method private just because it currently has one caller.
- Do not split code into more helpers than necessary. A single-use one-liner usually reads better inline.
- Name boolean-returning properties and methods with `is_` or `has_`, such as `is_workload_running` or `has_passwordless_sudo`.

## Working Rules

- Read `SPEC.md` before starting changes.
- Do not touch unrelated dirty files.
- Do not delete data directories.
- The top-level `benches/` directory is local data and must stay ignored.
- Use `apply_patch` for manual edits.
- Run `uv run ruff check admin pilot tests` after Python changes.
- Run targeted tests for narrow behavior changes and `uv run pytest` before committing broad refactors.
- For bug fixes, identify the root cause before attempting a fix.

## Docs

Keep docs concise and current. Human readers should find the workflow quickly. LLMs should find the source of truth, object boundaries, and safe edit locations without scanning long prose.
Keep Markdown prose on one continuous line; do not hard-wrap paragraphs.
